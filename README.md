# Contactlab Pattern Library UI Components
**Polymer 2 compatible version**

This is a hybrid version of the legacy Contactlab Pattern Library UI Components that works with ```Polymer 2``` using ```global CSS``` styles and ```ShadyDOM```.

The **hybrid** term is not releated to the Polymer Hybrid Elements (*elements that works on Polymer 2.x with 1.x syntax*) but to our approach to have a quick refactor of the components to work with Polymer 2 and as an NPM package but mainteining the styles in a global CSS file and not using Shadow DOM.

This is a required step **for us** since we need to upgrade our applications to Polymer 2 & NPM workflows while keeping this UI components with stable functionalities and appearance.

We are currently working on the **next iteration of our Design System** that will involve a complete rewrite of both styles and scripts of there components in a full Web Components v1 / Polymer 2 syntax.
